# Experiments with Multilingual Models for Hopespeech Detection

In an era where digital communication transcends borders and languages, the power of hope speech to inspire and uplift becomes increasingly significant. Hope, a beacon of optimism and resilience amidst adversity, manifests in textual content that fosters positivity and support within online communities. However, the vast and dynamic landscape of social media presents a formidable challenge in manually identifying and amplifying such content. This study embarks on a pioneering journey to bridge this gap by developing sophisticated models for detecting and classifying hope speech across a diverse linguistic spectrum, encompassing English, German, Spanish, and Urdu.

At the heart of our research lies the PolyHope-M task, a multifaceted challenge that beckons the research community to explore the nuances of hope speech detection. Our approach, under the banner of the MUCS team, leverages a rich tapestry of machine learning (ML) techniques to categorize texts into binary and multiclass classifications. By harnessing the power of Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) of word n-grams and multilingual embeddings, we train and evaluate various ML models, focusing on precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. Our emphasis on macro-averaged scores ensures a robust and consistent performance across the linguistic mosaic.

This research not only contributes to the fields of emotion detection, psychological linguistics, and cross-cultural Natural Language Processing (NLP) but also paves the way for AI-driven language models to understand and amplify hope speech in diverse linguistic contexts. As we present our findings at RANLP 2025, we invite the global research community to join us in fostering a more positive and supportive digital ecosystem, where hope speech transcends linguistic barriers and resonates across cultures.
